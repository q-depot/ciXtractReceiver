##Notes

Requires Cinder >= 0.8.5
The source code includes an Xcode example and CinderBlock templates.

##Get the code

cd CINDER_PATH/blocks

git clone git@github.com:q-depot/ciXtractReceiver.git


##How to use it
A working example can be found in the Samples folder, you can also use the TinderBox template to generate a new one.

```c++
#include "ciXtractReceiver.h"

class BasicApp : public AppNative 
{
	â€¦
	ciXtractReceiverRef    mXtractReceiver;
}

void BasicApp::setup() 
{
	mXtract = ciXtractReceiver::create();		// create an instance
}

void BasicApp::update() 
{
	mXtract->update();
}

void BasicApp::draw() 
{
	FeatureDataRef feature;
	feature = mXtract->getFeatureData( mAvailableFeatures[k] );
	ciXtractReceiver::drawData( feature, rect );		// utility to draw the data
}

```

##About LibXtract
> LibXtract is a simple, portable, lightweight library of audio feature extraction functions. The purpose of the library is to provide a relatively exhaustive set of feature extraction primatives that are designed to be 'cascaded' to create a extraction hierarchies.
